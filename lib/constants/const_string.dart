const kashiStory = 'Kashi Vishwanath Temple, temple located in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. It is among the most important Hindu temples in India and is one of the 12 temples where Shiva is believed to have appeared as a column of light.The Kashi Vishwanath Temple stands on the west bank of the Ganges River. It is dedicated to Shiva, who has been worshipped here for hundreds of years as Vishwanatha or Vishweshwara, “Lord of the Universe.”There were several earlier versions of the temple, possibly dating back more than a thousand years. The first recorded large-scale reconstruction was sanctioned by the Mughal emperor Akbar in 1585, but his great grandson Aurangzeb ordered its demolition in 1699 and used its debris for a new mosque near the site. The present structure, which is popularly known as the Golden Temple because of the gold used in the later plating of its spires and domes, is believed to have been built during the 18th century by Ahalya Bai of the Holkar dynasty.';
